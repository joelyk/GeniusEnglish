      "Comprendre les cinq sens, leurs fonctions et le vocabulaire cl&eacute;.",
    text: [
      "The five senses of the body include sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. Human beings and most other animals use the five senses to help them live and experience the world around them. The senses also help people to learn, protect themselves, and to enjoy the differences between foods, sounds, and other experiences a person has in life. The senses also work together to give you a clear picture of the activities around you.",
      "The first sense is sight, which depends on the eyes. People use their eyes to see the people, objects, and other items around them. Of course, the sense of sight is also helpful for reading, traveling, driving, and moving from place to place each day. Inside the eye there are special lenses that take in light to help people see things. If it is too dark, a person will have trouble seeing. The eyes can also adjust to the amount of light available. Many people, though, young and old, may also need glasses to help them see clearly. Some people may be able to see things up close, but not far away, which means they are nearsighted. If a person can see far away but not up close, they are farsighted. If a person is blind, there are special books written in braille which helps them feel the raised letters. Some blind people also have special dogs to help guide them from place to place in their home and when they go places.",
      "The second sense, hearing, depends on the ears. There are actually three parts of the ear, the outer ear, middle ear, and the inner ear. The outer ear is the part other people can see. The outer ear catches the sound waves as they travel to the person and then sends them into the ear. The outer ear acts like a funnel collecting the different sounds a person experiences. The middle ear contains the eardrum and several bones which transfers sound from the outer ear to the inner ear. The inner ear consists of tubes and passages that takes the sound vibrations and sends it to your brain for understanding.",
      "The third sense, smell, depends on your nose. Inside the nose there is a substance that takes the fumes of an odor and then sends it to the brain. If a person gets a cold the sense of smell may not be as strong. The nose also helps clean the air a person breathes by filtering it. Inside the nose there are tiny hairs, called cilia, which act as cleaners to help keep substances in the air from entering a person's body through the nose. In addition, the nose affects the way a person speaks. If a person holds their nose while speaking, their voice will sound different. Smell also helps with the sense of taste. As a person tastes the food in their mouth, the aroma of the food enters a person's nose.",
      "The next sense, feeling, or touch, can be experienced throughout the entire body through a person's skin. Some parts of the body are more sensitive to touch than other parts. The skin has parts in it that collect information and sends it the brain. Most of a person's feeling is done by the hands. In addition, when a person has a stomach ache or feel other kinds of pain, the sense of touch is working from inside the body.",
      "The final sense, taste, comes from the taste buds on a person's tongue. As stated earlier, the sense of smell also affects the sense of taste. The tongue tastes four different flavors: salty, sweet, sour, and bitter. Many foods a person eats may be a combination of the four main flavors. The tongue can also feel whether something in a person's mouth is hot, cold, creamy, crunchy, or dry.",
      "In summary, the five senses are sight, hearing, smell, feeling, and taste. The five senses work together to help you live, protect yourself, learn, and enjoy the world around you."

      "The basic scientific method includes the steps scientists use and follow when trying to solve a problem or prove or disprove a theory. The methods are used by scientists all over the world. This is done so scientists can work together to solve some of the same problems.",
      "There are usually five steps which are a part of the scientific method. The steps can occur in any order, but the first step is usually observation. An observation is the use of one or more of the five senses, which include seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, and tasting. The five senses are used to learn about or identify an event or object the scientist wants to study. For example, while observing a spider a scientist may observe the pattern or size of the spider's web.",
      "The second step of the scientific method is the question being researched, the hypothesis. It is the question that is turned into a statement about an event or object the scientist would like to research. A good hypothesis includes three things: The explanation for the observations, it is able to be tested by other scientists, and it will usually predict new outcomes or conclusions. The scientist observing the spider building the web may have a question about the strength of the web. An example of the hypothesis might be: The larger the spider, the stronger the web. This hypothesis includes the explanation for the observation, it can be tested, and new conclusions may be reached.",
      "The third step of the scientific method is the experiment. An experiment is a test which will either challenge or support the hypothesis. The hypothesis will then be true or false. Using the spider hypothesis, a scientist may experiment by measuring spider webs in relation to a spider's size. Often, even when a hypothesis is disproved much can still be learned during the experiment. For example, while measuring the strength of spider webs the scientist may discover something new about them.",
      "The final step in the scientific method is the conclusion. The conclusion will either clearly support the hypothesis or it will not. If the results support the hypothesis a conclusion can be written. If it does not support the hypothesis, the scientist may choose to change the hypothesis or write a new one based on what was learned during the experiment. In the example, if the scientist proves that larger spiders build stronger webs, then that is the conclusion. If it was not proven, the scientist may change the hypothesis to: The size of a spider does has no bearing on the strength of its web.",

      "In summary, the scientific method includes the steps scientists use to solve a problem or to prove or disprove a theory. There are four basic steps involved with the scientific method. The usual steps include observation, hypothesis, experiment, and conclusion. The steps may not always be completed in the same order. Following the four steps, the results of the experiment will either support the hypothesis or will not support the hypothesis. Scientists are always free to change or write a new hypothesis and start the four steps all over again. The scientific method is used for simple experiments or for more difficult experiments."

      "We all know that humans only give birth to humans; elephants only give birth to little elephants, giraffes to giraffes, dogs to dogs and so on for every type of living creature. But why is this so? The answer lies in a molecule called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which contains the biological instructions that make each species unique. DNA, along with the instructions it contains, is passed from adult organisms to their offspring during reproduction.",
      "DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. Nearly every cell in a person's body has the same DNA. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus (where it is called nuclear DNA), but a small amount of DNA can also be found in the mitochondria (where it is called mitochondrial DNA).",
      "The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Human DNA consists of about 3 billion bases, and more than 99 percent of those bases are the same in all people.",
      "The order, or sequence, of these bases determines the information available for building and maintaining an organism, similar to the way in which letters of the alphabet appear in a certain order to form words and sentences.",
      "DNA bases pair up with each other, A with T and C with G, to form units called base pairs. Each base is also attached to a sugar molecule and a phosphate molecule. Together, a base, sugar, and phosphate are called a nucleotide.",
      "Nucleotides are arranged in two long strands that form a spiral called a double helix. The structure of the double helix is somewhat like a ladder, with the base pairs forming the ladder's rungs and the sugar and phosphate molecules forming the vertical sidepieces of the ladder.",
      "An important property of DNA is that it can replicate, or make copies of itself. Each strand of DNA in the double helix can serve as a pattern for duplicating the sequence of bases. This is critical when cells divide because each new cell needs to have an exact copy of the DNA present in the old cell.",

      "DNA contains the instructions needed for an organism to develop, survive and reproduce. To carry out these functions, DNA sequences must be converted into messages that can be used to produce proteins, which are the complex molecules that do most of the work in our bodies. Each DNA sequence that contains instructions to make a protein is known as a gene.",
      "The size of a gene may vary greatly, ranging from about 1,000 bases to 1 million bases in humans. Genes only make up about 1 percent of the DNA sequence. DNA sequences outside this 1 percent are involved in regulating when, how and how much of a protein is made.",
      "Forensic scientists can use DNA in blood, semen, skin, saliva or hair to identify a matching DNA of an individual. This process is formally termed DNA profiling, but may also be called genetic fingerprinting. In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as short tandem repeats and minisatellites, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA."
